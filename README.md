### Running in CoreOS

There is a voter-registration-http-api@.service.template file provided in the repo. Look
it over and make any desired customizations before deploying. The
DOCKER_REPO, IMAGE_TAG, and CONTAINER values will all be set by the
build script.

The `script/build` and `script/deploy` scripts are designed to
automate building and deploying to CoreOS.

1. Run `script/build`.
1. Note the resulting image name and push it if needed.
1. Set your FLEETCTL_TUNNEL env var to a node of the CoreOS cluster
   you want to deploy to.
1. Make sure rabbitmq service is running.
1. Run `script/deploy`.
